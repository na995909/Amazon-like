# Amazon-like

I have created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL and Node. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete 
from the store's inventory. 

Packages needed fo the ap to input data and store it
- MySQL npm package been installed
- Inquirer npm package been insatalled

In this app,the user can choose which item to purchase by ID.
After inputting an appropriate quantity, the quantity will depelete available quantity for a product and also update the appropriate table with sales
